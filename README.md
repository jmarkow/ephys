These are a series of MATLAB scripts for analyzing extracellular recordings. I've left this repository here for posterity's sake, but this package has been superceded by the following:

1. [SPIKOsaurus CLUST](https://github.com/jmarkow/spikoclust) A streamlined set of MATLAB scripts for split-and-merge EM based spike-sorting
2. [robofinch](https://github.com/jmarkow/robofinch) A general MATLAB framework for automating common data analysis tasks and imaging and electrophysiology
