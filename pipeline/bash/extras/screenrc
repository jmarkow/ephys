# Example of automatically running some programs in windows on screen startup.
# Use the form: screen [-flag] [window name] [window number] [program to run in window]
# The -t flag means that the window in which that program is running
# closes when you exit that program, so if you quit pine
# window 2 closes.


# you will need to change these paths to point to your logfiles (relative paths don't seem
# to work here)
